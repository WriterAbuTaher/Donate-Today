          we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends
          up opening their wallets. In fact, a phenomenon known as compassion
          collapse can make people less generous following catastrophic
          situations or any time we are faced with many people in need.

          Survive is our need for food, water, and shelter. The survive
          instinct can get triggered around our paycheck because that's how we
          buy food, water, and shelter. the survive instinct is present when,
          people think to themselves, 'do we have the skills to be successful
          at my job.
